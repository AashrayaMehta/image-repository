# Image-Repository

This python applcation reads and interprets text from images.

This application uses Google Cloud Vision API to extract text from images.

The purpose of the search function I created works by asking the user what word or text they want to find in the set of images.

Then if the text entered by the user is found on any of the images, the applciaiton prints a message that a match has been found.

Otherwise, if no match is fond, this is stated.

The higher level use and purpose of this applcation is to help find certain key words in images that can be used for visual arts projects or picture galleries grouped based on identical text.

Hope you liked my Image Repository Project and find it heplful.

Note that the JSON file was generated by my Google Cloud account and the API key was also created throught my google cloud account.
